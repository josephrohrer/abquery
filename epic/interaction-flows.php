		<h3>Interaction flow for Tina Jenkins</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Tina decides to look at our site on her laptop to look up houses that she can potentially move to.</li>
			<li>The site displays a miniature version of the map that can be clicked to expand into a full version that will be coated in heatmap layers. And there will be a search option where they can input an address to search an area directly.</li>
			<li>Since she has a list of potential addresses she inputs one into the search bar.</li>
			<li>The site will send back cards with information on crime and parks which can be toggled or expanded to see the metadata.</li>
