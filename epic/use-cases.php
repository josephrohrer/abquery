		<h1>Persona Use Cases</h1>
		<h2>Tina Jenkins</h2>
		<p>Tina lives in Albuquerque but she is interested in moving to a new house in the same city with her family. One day at about 2:00 she decides to get on her laptop and search for a way to see if houses shes interested in are safe. She finds our site and looks into it and sees that there's an option to search places directly and puts one of the addresses into it. She sees that 18 kids have been hit by cars at an intersection half a mile away because there are no speed bumps (aside from the kids) and decides that house is not a good choice and moves on.</p>
		<h2>Steven Smtiherton</h2>
		<p>Steven has recently moved to Albuquerque for a job opening at GLoboGym and has been living in an apartment. He likes his apartment, but feels that it is a bit too far from the gym for his liking and wishes it had a larger yard for his dog, Protein. On his way to the gym, Steven notices a house that has everything he wants, fits his price range, and is within a weight vest walk to the gym. Because the safety of his dog and steroids are of the utmost importance, Steven decides to check if this house is near a park. He needs a quick, easy to read way to check out the neighborhood and see if there are any parks around to take Protein to. While weaving through traffic dangerously, he pulls out his phone. He types in the URL, enters the address of the house he's interested in, and is delighted to find that the neighborhood is very safe and, more importantly, that there are 2 parks within a mile. Satisfied with how quick he was able to get the information he needed, Steven decides to pay attention to the road between chugs of his sugar free Monster.</p>
		<h2>Burt Macklin</h2>
		<p>Burt needs to move his car restoration business out of his house's garage and into a new commercial building. On Monday morning, he received a complaint from one of his neighbors that there are too many cars on his property. He contacted his realtor who sends him a list of potential properties that he is able to lease. The safety of his customer's and their property is important to Burt so he uses ABQ Move Safe to cross reference the potential new garages in the area with crime data, such as stolen vehicles or vandalism, so that he can put his business in a safe area and protect his customer's assets.</p>
